# Email Verification System Deployment Guide

This guide covers the deployment of the email verification system to Railway, including database migrations and server updates.

## üìã Overview

The email verification system adds the following features:
- **Email verification during registration**
- **6-digit verification codes** sent to user emails
- **Verification code validation** with expiration (15 minutes)
- **Resend verification code** functionality
- **Account locking** after failed verification attempts
- **Database tracking** of verification status

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Fields Added to `users` Table

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `email_verified` | BOOLEAN | Whether email is verified (default: FALSE) |
| `verification_code` | VARCHAR(6) | 6-digit verification code |
| `verification_code_expires` | TIMESTAMP | When verification code expires |
| `verification_attempts` | INTEGER | Number of failed verification attempts |
| `last_verification_attempt` | TIMESTAMP | Last verification attempt timestamp |

### Database Functions Added

- `generate_verification_code()` - Generates random 6-digit codes
- `is_verification_code_expires()` - Checks if code is expired

### Indexes Added

- `idx_users_verification_code` - For fast verification code lookups
- `idx_users_email_verified` - For email verification status queries

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Run the email verification migration
node run_email_verification_migration.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üöÄ Starting Email Verification Database Migration...
‚úÖ Connected to database
üìù Executing email verification migration...
‚úÖ Email verification migration completed successfully!
üìä Added fields:
   - email_verified (BOOLEAN)
   - verification_code (VARCHAR(6))
   - verification_code_expires (TIMESTAMP)
   - verification_attempts (INTEGER)
   - last_verification_attempt (TIMESTAMP)
üîß Added functions:
   - generate_verification_code()
   - is_verification_code_expired()
üìà Added indexes for performance
üîí Added constraints for data integrity
üîå Database connection closed
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Using Deployment Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Make script executable (if not already)
chmod +x deploy_email_verification.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy_email_verification.sh
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Deploy to Railway
railway up

# Check deployment status
railway status
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "app": "IBDPal",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "memory": {...},
  "database": "connected"
}
```

## üß™ Testing the System

### Run Automated Tests

```bash
# Test the email verification system
node test_email_verification.js
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Registration Flow:**
   - Register a new user
   - Check that `requiresVerification: true` is returned
   - Verify code is logged to console (check Railway logs)

2. **Login Without Verification:**
   - Try to login with unverified account
   - Should receive 401 error with `requiresVerification: true`

3. **Resend Verification:**
   - Call resend verification endpoint
   - New code should be generated and logged

4. **Invalid Verification:**
   - Try to verify with wrong code
   - Should receive 400 error

## üîß Server Endpoints

### New Endpoints Added

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/auth/verify-email` | POST | Verify email with 6-digit code |
| `/api/auth/resend-verification` | POST | Resend verification code |

### Modified Endpoints

| Endpoint | Changes |
|----------|---------|
| `/api/auth/register` | Now requires email verification |
| `/api/auth/login` | Now checks for email verification |

## üìß Email Integration (TODO)

Currently, verification codes are logged to the console. For production, implement actual email sending:

### Recommended Email Services

1. **SendGrid** - Popular email service
2. **Mailgun** - Developer-friendly
3. **AWS SES** - Cost-effective for high volume
4. **Nodemailer** - For custom SMTP

### Implementation Steps

1. Install email service package
2. Add email service credentials to environment variables
3. Replace console.log with actual email sending
4. Test email delivery

## üîí Security Features

### Rate Limiting
- Verification attempts tracked per user
- Account locked after 5 failed attempts
- 15-minute expiration for verification codes

### Data Protection
- Verification codes are 6-digit random numbers
- Codes are cleared after successful verification
- Failed attempts are logged and tracked

## üìä Monitoring

### Railway Logs
```bash
# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Filter for verification codes
railway logs | grep "üìß"
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check verification status
SELECT email, email_verified, verification_attempts 
FROM users 
WHERE email_verified = FALSE;

-- Check locked accounts
SELECT email, verification_attempts, account_locked 
FROM users 
WHERE account_locked = TRUE;
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration Fails**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify PostgreSQL version compatibility
   - Check for existing columns

2. **Deployment Fails**
   - Check Railway CLI installation
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check server logs

3. **Verification Not Working**
   - Check database migration completed
   - Verify new endpoints are accessible
   - Check Railway logs for errors

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check database connection
node -e "require('./database/db.js').query('SELECT NOW()').then(console.log)"

# Test server locally
cd server && npm start

# Check Railway status
railway status
```

## üìù Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Railway:

```env
# Database
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Server
NODE_ENV=production
SERVER_PORT=3004

# Email (for future implementation)
EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid
EMAIL_API_KEY=your-email-api-key
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Database migration runs without errors
2. ‚úÖ Railway deployment completes successfully
3. ‚úÖ Health endpoint responds correctly
4. ‚úÖ Registration requires email verification
5. ‚úÖ Login blocks unverified users
6. ‚úÖ Verification codes are generated and logged
7. ‚úÖ Resend verification works
8. ‚úÖ Invalid codes are rejected

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Database Rollback:**
   ```sql
   -- Remove verification fields (if needed)
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS email_verified;
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS verification_code;
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS verification_code_expires;
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS verification_attempts;
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_verification_attempt;
   ```

2. **Server Rollback:**
   - Revert to previous Railway deployment
   - Or deploy previous version of auth.js

## üìû Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Railway documentation
2. Review server logs
3. Test database connectivity
4. Verify environment variables
