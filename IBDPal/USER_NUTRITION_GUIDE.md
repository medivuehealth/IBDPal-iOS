# IBDPal Nutrition Guide for Users

## How Your Personal Nutrition Targets Are Calculated

IBDPal automatically calculates your daily nutrition targets based on your personal profile. Here's how it works in simple terms:

## Scientific Foundation
Our nutrition targets are based on official recommendations from the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**:
- **Primary Source**: [NIH Office of Dietary Supplements](https://ods.od.nih.gov/HealthInformation/nutrientrecommendations.aspx)
- **DRI Calculator**: [NIH DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals](https://ods.od.nih.gov/HealthInformation/nutrientrecommendations.aspx)

## How the App Works
- **Real-time Calculation**: Your nutrition targets are calculated instantly when you open the app
- **No Internet Required**: All the science-based standards are built into the app
- **Always Up-to-Date**: The app uses the latest NIH recommendations

## What Information We Use

### 1. Your Basic Profile
- **Gender**: Male or Female (affects baseline needs)
- **Age**: Your current age (affects nutrient requirements)
- **Weight**: Your current weight (used for some calculations)

### 2. Your Health Status
- **Disease Type**: 
  - Normal/Healthy person
  - IBD patient (Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis)
- **Disease Activity Level**:
  - Remission (no active symptoms)
  - Mild (some symptoms)
  - Moderate (noticeable symptoms)
  - Severe (significant symptoms)

## How We Calculate Your Targets

### Step 1: Start with Science-Based Standards
We use official nutrition recommendations from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as our starting point. These are the same standards used by doctors and dietitians.

### Step 2: Adjust for Your Gender and Age
- **Men** typically need more calories and protein than women
- **Older adults** (over 50) may need slightly more of certain nutrients
- **Young adults** (under 18) need extra nutrients for growth

### Step 3: Account for Your Health Condition
- **Healthy people**: Get standard nutrition targets
- **IBD patients**: Get 20% higher targets because your body may not absorb nutrients as well

### Step 4: Adjust for Your Current Health Status
- **Remission**: Standard IBD targets
- **Mild symptoms**: 10% increase
- **Moderate symptoms**: 20% increase  
- **Severe symptoms**: 30% increase

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Sarah - Healthy 30-year-old Woman
- **Profile**: Female, 30 years old, no health conditions
- **Daily Targets**:
  - Calories: 2,000
  - Protein: 46g
  - Fiber: 25g
  - Water: 2.7 liters

### Example 2: Mike - IBD Patient in Remission
- **Profile**: Male, 28 years old, Crohn's Disease (remission)
- **Daily Targets**:
  - Calories: 3,000 (20% higher than healthy person)
  - Protein: 67g (20% higher)
  - Fiber: 46g (20% higher)
  - Water: 4.4 liters (20% higher)

### Example 3: Lisa - IBD Patient with Moderate Symptoms
- **Profile**: Female, 35 years old, Ulcerative Colitis (moderate activity)
- **Daily Targets**:
  - Calories: 2,880 (44% higher than healthy person)
  - Protein: 66g (44% higher)
  - Fiber: 36g (44% higher)
  - Water: 3.9 liters (44% higher)

## Why These Targets Matter

### For Healthy People
- Maintains optimal health
- Prevents nutrient deficiencies
- Supports immune system
- Provides energy for daily activities

### For IBD Patients
- **Higher protein**: Helps repair damaged tissue
- **More calories**: Compensates for poor absorption
- **Extra vitamins/minerals**: Replaces what's lost due to inflammation
- **Adequate hydration**: Prevents dehydration from diarrhea

## Getting the Most from Your Targets

### 1. Check Your Dashboard Daily

- Contact your healthcare provider if you have concerns

### 4. Use the Recommendations
- The app suggests foods that help you meet your targets
- These suggestions are personalized to your specific needs

## When to Adjust Your Profile

### Update Your Weight
- If you gain or lose more than 5-10 pounds
- This affects your calorie and protein needs

### Update Disease Activity
- If your symptoms change significantly
- This affects your overall nutrient needs

### Update Age
- On your birthday (if you're under 18 or over 50)
- This affects your baseline requirements
